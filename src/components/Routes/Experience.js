    <p>Graduated in Business Administration, I have developed a career in management where I gained vast knowledge
    of the retail industry as Customer and Trading Manager, demonstrating my ability to use 
    the data and technology available to deliver the best customer experience to the lowest possible cost.  
    This was achieved by analysing Store and Regional data to achieve Sales, Waste, Shrink and Labour targets.
    Some of the tools used were company's own data base (RSS), Kronos for labour management and Excel. </p>
